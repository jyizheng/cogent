-- [amos] Type-solver changes I made:
-- - Simplify rule for `t :=: t` to `Solved t` (see Solver/Simplify.hs)
--    A constraint like "?a :=: ?a" is almost trivial, except that you need the `Solved` constraint to make sure ?a is given a concrete assignment eventually
-- - Add Sink/float stage (see Solver/SinkFloat.hs)
--    When the upper bound of a record subtyping constraint has some field as present, we know the lower bound must also have that field present.
-- - Add Defaults stage (see Solver/Defaults.hs)
--    Choosing the smallest size for integer literals, when there are multiple upcast constraints on same unification variable
-- - Reorder Equate stage before JoinMeet:
--    The new Sink/float stage can apply when Equate does, but Sink/float introduces potentially many new constraints, while Equate is simpler and just replaces a subtyping constraint with equality.
-- [vjackson] Type-solver changes I have made:
-- * expand sink/float to all types, and map under all type-operators
-- * remove join/meet
